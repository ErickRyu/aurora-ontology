# Embodied Knowledge Persists

Knowledge that changes how I act becomes part of me. Knowledge that only exists in my head eventually fades.

When I learned to ride a bicycle, the understanding became embodied in my muscle memory and balance. I can't forget it because it's not stored as information - it's stored as capability.

Similarly, when I truly understand a concept, it changes how I perceive and interact with the world. The understanding is distributed across my behavior patterns, not just localized in memory.

This explains why cramming for exams produces temporary knowledge that vanishes after the test. The information never had time to integrate with action.

For learning to stick, I need to:
1. Act on new understanding immediately
2. Find ways to embody abstract concepts in concrete practices
3. Create feedback loops between understanding and action

The question is not "Do I know this?" but "Has this changed how I live?"
