# On the Nature of Understanding

I've noticed that true understanding doesn't come from accumulating information. It comes from connecting ideas in ways that reveal something new.

When I read a book, I might remember facts, but understanding emerges when those facts interact with my existing knowledge and create new patterns.

This makes me wonder about the difference between knowing and understanding. Can you know something without understanding it? And can you understand something without being able to explain it?

The process seems recursive - understanding often leads to new questions, which lead to deeper understanding.
