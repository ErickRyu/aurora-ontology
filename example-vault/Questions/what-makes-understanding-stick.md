# What makes understanding "stick"?

I've had many moments of insight that felt profound at the time, but faded within days or weeks. Meanwhile, some understandings from years ago remain vivid and applicable.

What's the difference? Is it:
- The emotional intensity of the original insight?
- How often I've revisited and applied it?
- How well it connected to existing knowledge?
- Something about the structure of the insight itself?

I suspect it's related to how the insight changes my behavior or thinking patterns. Understanding that becomes embodied in action seems to persist. But understanding that remains abstract tends to fade.

How do I design my learning process to create more lasting understanding?
